**Research Question**: How has growing up in a single-parent-headed-families affected adults in terms of their **Educational** **Attainment**, initiation, perception, and maintenance of **Romantic** **Relationships**, and the experience of **Emotional Distress** and acquisition of **Resilience**?

## **1.  Introduction**

The difficulties single parents face is often numerous and closely intertwined, making their experience a subject of great interest to policymakers, researchers and the general public alike. Research on the phenomenon of single parenthood focuses greatly on the experience of the parents and the arduous circumstances they are put in. These circumstances not only impair the quality of life for these parents greatly but also the outcome of their children. Every facet of their dilemma from time poverty to work-life balance would reverberate to the lives of their children. But the experience of the child/children of single-parent (COSP) are often framed in terms of their outcomes, not how their lives have been shaped by the same intricately complex webs of factors similar, but also different in meaningful nuances, to their parents. Thus, it would be as helpful and insightful to consider the difficulties of single-parenthood from the perspectives of those who are the progeny of these parents and their accompanying challenges, the adult child/children of single-parent (ACOSP).

Through three main lenses, it will be possible to reconstruct in greater detail the experience of being brought up in a single-parent-headed-household in Singapore: Education, Romantic Relationships, and Emotional Distress & Resilience. Education was chosen due to its high correlation with career outcome and future earnings. Romantic Relationships would help in examining how these adult children conduct themselves in intimate relationships; this, in turn, would reveal their approach to problem-solving in deeply invested connections. Finally, the felt level of emotional distress and the ability to maintain resilience would aid in the understanding of how their stability has been affected by the experience and whether such an experience would depreciate their ability to withstand future traumatic experiences. These three main lenses were chosen due to the fact that ACOSP often suffer in these categories when they were growing up or even when they have reached adulthood, impairing their career prospects, quality of life, and general well-being[\[1\]](#_ftn1).

## **2.  Methodology and Sample**

### **a.   Methodology**

In order to fully capture how the numerous factors in the lives of ACOSP play off and interact with each other, the method of choice was qualitative interviews supplemented by short surveys which measure self-reported happiness and self-efficacy.

Qualitative interviews were conducted with each respondent in 1 to 1.5 hours blocs with two interviewers, one principal and one auxiliary. Qualitative interviews are helpful as they allow researchers to expand the web of influences with regards to one factor in greater details. This is invaluable as it would prove very difficult, especially with a sample overrepresented by outliers, to highlight intervening factors and explain the nuances behind them if quantitative methods are utilized. The questionnaire covers a wide range of topics even beyond Education, Romantic Relationship, and Emotional Distress & Resilience, though they received special attention certainly, due to the planned usage of the results by others on the task force. This diversity of coverage offers a great advantage in clearing up causal linkages which would have been confounding if the topics were more focused. A common example of this which appears in the sample is how separation can indirectly affect ACOSP’s outcomes through a series of factors which normally would not be linked with the three aforementioned topics. However, the use of a detail-oriented questionnaire possesses a weakness in its demand for longer interview sessions; this was not possible for most interviewees, leading to an incomplete web of influences or unclarified obfuscations in some cases. Furthermore, the interpersonal nature of qualitative interviews might affect the answers given by the respondents, specifically in the amelioration of their own situations out of personal pride, despite reality. Yet, it is possible to alleviate this self-reported bias somewhat through a blind quantitative survey.

Supplementary quantitative scales for self-reported Happiness and Self-efficacy were used in order to fill in gaps where present in the qualitative interviews. The surveys were done by participants without supervision by the interviewers, allowing the participants to answer truer to their thoughts than they otherwise would. The results of the surveys have served to contradict some statements or version of events in the qualitative interviews; this helps provide researchers with a truer and more complete picture of the lives of respondents.

### **b.   Sample**

The sample consists of four subjects who fulfill three criteria: Having been a child of a single parent at least before the age of 16, having lived or is living in a low-income household, and is over 16 years of age at the time of the interview. For the criteria of low-income, the following are general thresholds used to filter potential candidates:

-   Anyone family living in HDB rental housing (irrespective of income)

-   Household income of S\$1,800 for Household size of 2 or 3

-   Household income of S\$2,300 for Household size of 4 or 5

-   Household income of S\$3-3,500 for Household size of 6+

Table 1 gives an overview of the demographics of the sample; all names are interviewer-assigned pseudonyms. The most noteworthy aspect of the sample is that every participant is currently pursuing a Bachelor degree at top-ranking universities in Singapore. This fact alone might reduce the generalizability of the findings presented here due to their anomalous nature compared to the literature and past data on ACOSP’s educational attainment. However, the finding from this sample could give a unique perspective on how to tackle the causal mechanisms leading to lowered educational attainment among ACOSP. Additionally, the reason and circumstances leading to each participant becoming an ACOSP are unique, giving the sample diversity and allowing for the examination of the literature against many unique contexts, testing its reliability. Every participant completed both the qualitative interview and the quantitative survey.

## **3.  Education**

### **a.   Literature Review**

According to estimated statistics, on average, post-secondary education in Singapore can bring in roughly S\$3,000 in extra income per month. In other words, post-secondary degree holders earn about double the amount that non-degree workers receive. These statistics are even more astounding when one considers that on the median, unaffected by top-percentile income, university degree holders earn roughly S\$1000 more than other technical degree holders[\[2\]](#_ftn2). Thus, it is clear how education could be life-changing for those who chose to pursue it. Unfortunately, post-secondary educational attainment is not always an option available to all. In fact, ACOSP are poised to be at a disadvantage when it comes to educational attainment on most levels, post-secondary included[\[3\]](#_ftn3).

When put in comparison with children from a household with married-biological-parent, children in alternative families, specifically children who grew up with a single parent or has experienced parental separation, performs much more poorly and generally have a lower level of educational attainment in terms of degree[\[4\]](#_ftn4). More specifically, there has been evidence that the test performance of COSP is lower before the separation event for divorce and continues to decrease after the separation[\[5\]](#_ftn5). As has been stated previously, this fact should be deeply alarming due to the correlation between educational attainment and later outcomes in life. Despite one’s personal morals and opinions on the matter of single-parenthood, it should be clear that COSP’s academic progress suffers greatly from the consequences of separation, something no one involved in the debate would desire; therefore, it is a problem which must be addressed. And, in order to effectively tackle this, the literature has much to offer as to why this trend is unfolding. Specifically, there are 3 general explanations: resource deprivation, instability and stress caused by unstable family structure, and the selection effect stemming from pre-existing characteristics of the marriage.

Resource deprivation is one of the most popular and intuitively logical explanation of why COSP experience worse academic performance. It provides a straightforward reason why children of single-parent headed households, specifically divorced households, are disadvantaged; this is because they lack the resources children from traditional families receive. When separation happens, single-parent headed households often face more hardships compared to a traditional family due to their split financial capabilities, increased burden on the custodial parent, and the accompanying distress among members of the family. The impact of reduced socioeconomic status is particularly harmful as it limits the educational opportunities that children of divorce possess. This reduction is engendered because the household no longer have a significant source of income and the custodial parent must take on a job to care for his/her children in the absence of the other spouse. The increased demand on the single parent, whose vocational choice is often limited, places a strain on the family’s finances as well as the time parents has to engage their children academically[\[6\]](#_ftn6). A decrease in socio-economic capability would limit the choices in terms of schooling, the ability to purchase school equipment, and the opportunities to engage in extra- or co-curricular activities such as extra tuition, academic clubs, non-academic communal activities; all of these factors together would reduce the amount of academic socialization and capability that COSP receive[\[7\]](#_ftn7). This entails that COSP might not see the purpose of education or the need to invest in it due to their lack of integration into the education system. Supposedly, being in a single-parent household would deprive COSP of such integration because of the lack of good educational environment in terms of schooling and the absence of other activities which might tie children to academic success[\[8\]](#_ftn8). Most notably, this would include the missing human capital, or parental qualifications, and social capital that COSP are missing. The lack of parental human capital means the educational level of parents themselves, the status of which might affect how their children view the importance of education or approach their parents for help[\[9\]](#_ftn9). Social capital, on the other hand, can refer to the level of involvement between parent and children as well according to some researchers as well as the involvement of children in non-familial relationships such as the involvement with their teachers, friends, the school, extra-curricular activities and clubs[\[10\]](#_ftn10). Both involvements are vital as they inculcate the values of education in children through their interaction with their parents and their peers. Furthermore, investments in these activities would integrate children into the education system, making it more difficult for them to fall through the cracks[\[11\]](#_ftn11). Being in a single-parent household would strip children of these capitals due to the lack of time parents have to interact with their children and the reduction in financial resources reducing their opportunities to enjoy extra-curricular activities. Thus, single-parent-headed households would reduce the academic socialization of children because they possess fewer resources; this would then lead to the lowering of academic capability and eventually impair educational attainment in COSP.

Instability and stress are the second popular explanation as to why COSP have poorer educational attainment and results compared to children of traditional families. The major effect of being in single-parent headed households is the instability it causes for the child and the deprivation of parental emotional support. This is exceptionally worrying because divorce, a major reason for creating single-parent headed households, is not a singular event, rather it is ripple with reverberating effects on children’s lives. These effects include emotional distress, anti-social behaviors, and other dysfunctional characteristics[\[12\]](#_ftn12). It is COSP’s pre-occupation with these distresses or rather their inability to resolve them that reduce their academic capability. This could be visualized by imagining a child who has gone through trauma immediately following the divorce; however, his parent is not there to help him reconcile with what has just happened and the current arrangements. In some cases, the continued presence of parental conflict or other parent-induced distress could exacerbate the situation even further[\[13\]](#_ftn13). Due to his unresolved emotional and psychological challenges, the child would not be able to focus on his studies as his mental capacity is taken up by these pre-occupations. He would face emotional instability, severe distress, and develop anti-social or anger-driven behaviours which would further hinder him from being integrated academically or develop healthy academic habits[\[14\]](#_ftn14). Unfortunately, the effects of these distresses would accumulate and compound with time rather than dissipate, often due to them being left unresolved[\[15\]](#_ftn15). This accumulative effect has been shown to continuously widen the gap between COSP and children of traditional families, reducing their educational attainment further as time goes on[\[16\]](#_ftn16). Thus, the child’s academic endeavours would be foiled progressively by the separation due to the stresses related to it.

![](images/clipboard-3086886272.png)

The last school of thought concerns Selection; this school is differentiated from others is that it considers the reasons causing the separation to be the same reasons which contribute to lower educational attainment in COSP. It makes the case that households with certain characteristics are more predisposed to experience separation and it is these same characteristics which later on might disadvantage children in educational attainment. In other words, single-parent headed household and lower educational attainment both stem from the same source rather than being in a causal relationship with each other. Selection theorists’ postulate that lower educational attainment for children of divorce is not due to the separation but rather because there are existing characteristics in the family structure which might hamper academic socialization. These characteristics are inherent to the marriage, or the parents, and will persist or lighten after the separation. Thus, it’s not that parental separation which causes low educational attainment in children, but rather a couple who separate might be prone to possess characteristics which are not conducive to socializing children academically. These characteristics might actually be less prevalent after the couple has separated. Some characteristics might include parental conflict, the age of the mother at the time of birth, etc. These characteristics would exist even before the separation and can be construed as causes of separation. Thus, they will induce lower educational attainment, not due to the invocation of separation, but due to their inherent depressive effects on educational attainment. This was demonstrated by Björklund and Sundström (2006) using a Swedish sample. When considering siblings of the same biological parents, one sibling having reached 18 before the separation and one below 18 before the separation, it can be established that their earning-weighted education (earnings based on level of education) are not drastically different enough as to be explained by the separation itself rather than other characteristics of the marriage which have existed long prior to the separation. This is significant as it belies the important assumption that the separation itself is the turning point for the generation of factors which lower educational attainment[\[17\]](#_ftn17).

### **b.   Analysis**

In order to examine the validity of each causal chains, the interview instruments were crafted in order to capture important elements shared between each of the school of thought as well as factors that are exclusive to them. The questions focused on what academic expectations the ACOSP had for themselves when they were young, what were their motivations, if any, to continue their education, and what factors, familial or otherwise, helped or deterred them in their academic career. This would allow participants to bring up any deficiencies in their financial situation and allow researchers to elucidate the state of their possession of human and social capital. Most importantly, however, the instrument can help determine their level of academic socialization at the very least; this would then facilitate the analysis of how they have reached their level of socialization.

When considering the resource deprivation experienced by ACOSP, the sample interestingly presented shocking inconsistencies which what is probably one of the most popular explanations for lower educational attainment in the COSP population; all participants are currently enrolled in top-ranking universities in Singapore in an educational environment which have been described as “ruthless”. This means that the sample of respondents here might be filled with outliers to the Singapore population, but this is not verifiable. However, it would be fruitful to consider the reasons why respondents did not conform to the usual pattern leading to academic failure. Notably, most inconsistencies cropped up in the link between deprivation and lower academic socialization. This means that deprivation does indeed exist, and in many cases are extremely salient to respondents’ lives. Yet, through one reason or another, they have managed to overcome this causal structure.

**i.    Cher**

In the case of Cher, her parents divorced when she was six; the separation impacted her emotionally and psychologically greatly even until today. Cher resides with her mother, an older brother, and a younger sister. The size of her household and the fact that her father does not provide divorce maintenance means that her mother had to take it upon herself to provide for the family. According to Cher, her mother works approximately twelve hours each day and is often exhausted once reaching home. Yet, this had often been insufficient to provide for everyone in the family. As Cher described, there would be times when there wouldn’t be enough food and “what happened was she gave us food" while she abstained from eating. This situation is compounded by the fact that Cher attended a school, an Islamic religious school; the tuition can run from S\$80 a month for primary schooling to S\$120 a month for secondary schooling. For comparison, public schools in Singapore cost from S\$13 a month for primary schooling to S\$25 a month for secondary school[\[18\]](#_ftn18). Thus, Cher stated that there were many times her family could not afford to pay her tuition fee for her and her brother.

*“And it was extra harder for us because we don’t come from a very wealthy family lah. All my friends, I would say are considered wealthy, because they are, they can afford. One thing is, you have to afford lah to go to a school.”*

Thus, it is clear that Cher’s financial resources were significantly reduced due to her family single-parent status, despite her mother’s heavy work schedule. This is a reality that Cher had not been able to forget, in fact, one of her constant worries is about her family finances. “I’m worried about money; I’m worried about money.” Additionally, when she was younger, the social capital of parental involvement was hard to find as well; Cher’s mother worked very long hour which prevented her from being deeply involved with Cher. This made Cher feel that she “lack mother love” (sic). It is clear that Cher lacked financial resources and the supply of social capital in the form of emotional investment from her parent. Yet, in Cher’s case, there are variables which have intervened in the process of socializing her academically. The first and foremost of this is the fact that she enjoyed studying to a great extent. She proclaimed that she is the “study type”. When inquired about what she would do with extra free time, she simply answered with “study”. Aside from her passion for studying, she also viewed it as an escape, or as a solution; this is because she finds that “you cannot go anywhere without your study”, a mantra she had tried to pass on to her younger sister. An important factor as to why she views education as a solution is the fact that she can see a correlation between studying and relief or mitigation in her situation. This would have concretized the notion that with studying, one can actually achieve relief from financial difficulties.

*“I feel like if I didn’t get good grades, they would kick me out. I honestly feel that. Because we are really, there was one time we didn’t pay for an entire year”*

Education as a solution is unique to Cher in her household as her younger sister left the academic path rather early. This might support the notion that seeing the results between success in education and relief was good for Cher as she described her younger sister as not being as academically adept. However, her perception of “education as a solution” does not exist without major supporting factors from her environment; the most notable of which is the social capital given to her by the school environment, in terms of friendship and the teacher-student relationship. Due to the size and structure of the school, a small group of students can remain in the same class for 10 years of schooling with the same set of teachers, cementing their relationship. It is this network of close-knit relationships that most likely kept Cher integrated into the educational environment, through her social support networks. Cher views her friends from primary school as “really like a family” and she appreciates the school environment as one where “everyone tends to help each other”, teachers and students alike. This might go further to emphasize how important education is to Cher as a solution, education is where she can find emotional support, where she develops deep friendships. Thus, it would be natural to see education as a solution to what her family could not provide for her, in terms of financial stability and emotional support. Cher’s academic socialization was then strengthened by viewing education as a solution, supported by the social capital in her environment.

Distress due to the separation is something Cher most definitely experienced. This is emphasized again and again throughout the interview as she described how the memories of the separation are still quite raw for her. However, not once did she mention that her emotional distress has prevented her from studying or from her education. This might be because the importance of education is so paramount that it has been separated from the effects of stress and emotional distress. In other words, this means that Cher has elevated education to the level where distress is something that happened but it should not interfere with her ability to study simply because education is so vital to her as a solution to her problem. Thus, the view of “education as a solution” again intervenes here in mitigating the effects of instability and stress. Yet, it is essential to recognize that this is not the only way Cher deals with the distress from the separation as she also possesses other coping tools. This brings attention to the fact that there are other intervening factors with regards to separation-related distress that is not captured by the literature in considering its effect on education. The section of “Emotion Distress and Resilience” would cover this in further details.

**ii.    Hope**

Hope’s situation is considerably different from the other three respondents in this sample. she became a child of a single parent because her father passed when she was at the end of her 3^rd^ year of her Secondary School when she was fifteen. However, similar to Cher, Hope’s family also landed into financial difficulties after her family’s equivalent of a “separation event”. Hope lives with her mother and her older sister. As her father was the breadwinner of the house, his passing had a major impact on the family both financially and emotionally, especially for her mother. Her mother had to convert her job as a theatre production operator into a full-time job, but it did not pay enough. Though she stated that her family wasn’t in destitution, the paradigm had shifted and now money is a constant concern.

*“We had to be more frujal, frugal- frugal, sorry. But then, it’s not to say that we don’t have money but you know that it’ll always be a concern. It’s just not as comfortable as it was before with my dad.”*

It was clear through the interview that the finances are something which she doesn’t often think about as the specificity of her financial situation might be deeply worrying to her. However, she does hold it in the back of her head as something which constantly stays on her mind.

*“Yea, but I don’t track it. So, just sometimes, occasionally, when we go to the bank right and she withdraws money then I’m like: “How much do we have left?” She doesn’t like to say so, um- but I know, sometimes right, I accidentally peeked at the number, right, it goes down.”*

Not only that, as a solution to her financial problems, Hope had tried to pick up part-time jobs here and there to alleviate the financial burden on her mother; in fact, this is something that her mother had encouraged her to do. Aside from this, Hope’s parents most likely did not attend college as she said her parents “weren’t educated”. This went to show that Hope’s situation was categorized by a lack of financial and human capital. It would have been easy for a person in Hope’s situation to drop out of school in order to work to relieve the financial burden on her mother, seeing that you did not necessarily need an education to survive, similar to her parents. This is made the more likely as her father’s vocation earned “quite a lot” despite the fact that he did not possess a substantial amount of education. From qualitative data, it appears Hope was able to put effort into continuing her education mainly because of her social capital, specifically her parents’ development of her view of education and her social support network. She was inculcated with the value of education from her parents who “placed a very strong emphasis on education”. Her parents valued education greatly and this mindset was passed onto her. This was made clear by her assertion that education is something that “allows me to have an opportunity to better prospects”.

*“That’s why they worked so hard lah, to send me to tuitions. Any extra things that can boost my IQ, they’ll send me to (laughter). Basically, it’s more tuition lah.”*

Similar to Cher, Hope had a strong educational network of support, in both her teachers and her friends. This probably contributed to her decision to stay in schooling, but most likely not as much as her view that education can help improve her situation. Hope cherished how her friends would stay to study with her and they would help each other with work as well as the fact that her school mentoring system assigned a specific teacher to help, he with schoolwork. It is these informal support systems that help socialize COSP into the education system, making it harder for them to drop out, yet, COSP often do not have access to them; one must definitely balance this web with the fact that financial resources often preclude such considerations in the first place[\[19\]](#_ftn19). As Hope described it, her network helped provide her with consistency in a difficult period in her life as well as help for her in focusing on studying and education.

*“In terms of education, I, I think I had quite a bit of, uh, support from my friends, so it’s ok. My friends would study with me. And in Sec 4, my school introduced mentorship. So, there’s this teacher who would take care of about 4 students. So, my teacher was- he was actually my- he was my science teacher. And then, he taught chemistry and physics, I think. And, then, apart from that, he also helped with other subjects I was weak in like maths. So, education wise, I think, like, it was still ok, you know, consistent work.”*

Thus, Hope resembles Cher in that the reason why they could escape the link between resource deprivation and poor academic socialization is the fact that they view education as a solution, making it a paramount purpose rather than just an ordinary choice. And similarly, this choice was strengthened and embedded in their daily lives by the existence of a strong support network centered around their schools.

With regards to instability and stress, Hope’s case is special in that she was not dealing with divorce but rather with the grief of losing a loved one. However, there doesn’t seem to be any link between this grief and poor academic socialization. In fact, due to her father’s death and the fact that her parents have emphasized the importance of education so strongly, Hope’s conviction in education may have increased independent of the worries and stress. Furthermore, the fact that her father’s lack of substantial education and their family subsequent lack of a financial safety net after his passing could contribute to how she sees the importance of education. This extrapolation is made as Hope drew a very strong connection between her family’s lack of savings, due to the nature of her father’s vocation, and the current financial difficulties they are facing. Furthermore, the support system she had developed in school clearly played a very major role in how she had tried to cope with her father passing, further strengthening the linkage between school and this system of support.

**iii.    Marco**

Marco became a COSP after his mother filed for divorce due to his father’s infidelity. After the divorce, he went to live with his mother, his older brother, and his grandparents. Though Marco’s financial situations were much more unstable in the past, due to his mother’s profession being largely seasonal, it is now more stable. However, when he was young, the reality of his family’s financial difficulties was not lost on him. In fact, even in their current financial situation, his household still has to live frugally, something he is painfully aware of. One of the reasons why his family faced such hardship was because his father stopped paying divorce maintenance after some time and his mother did not want to press the issue. According to Marco, there were many times when the utility in his house would be cut off when he was around 12. Marco seems indifferent about it, explaining that he has gotten used to it with time. He went on to say that they had to “tighten their belts” in order to make ends meet. Additionally, he explained that he often felt helpless due to his inability to change the situation. In describing a time when utilities were suddenly cut off, he said:

*“So then after that, I mean like, what could we do, we couldn’t do anything, I was like at most 12? Yeah. Then I just went back to my room, just lie down and… yeah. Just wait for things to change. But there’s nothing else I could have done.”*

In addition to this, Marco’s very aware of his family situation, as he recalled how he would question whether his mother had enough money to manage for herself when he was receiving an allowance. Thus, it is clear that Marco’s financial circumstances were difficult, to say the least. Marco described his mother as being supportive in his education because neither his father nor mother went on to higher education. This is particularly interesting as Marco lacks the human capital from his parents but was compensated with the encouragement for further education, a form of social capital. Beyond that, there is not much information to describe other forms of social capital as he did not talk much about his teachers or how felt at school. It is different from Cher and Hope who had friends with whom they can study or would maintain their connections with the educational environment. For Marco, the most notable memory which he recounted was how he felt betrayed by his school friends who stigmatized him due to his situation. This experience would relate more toward Resilience but it does demonstrate how Marco’s social capital in school was not as strong, definitely in comparison with Cher and Hope.

Marco’s perseverance with his education, then, is more difficult to explain. In such situations, it would be easier to imagine a COSP trying to find a job to supplement the family’s income rather than continue with education, especially with higher education[\[20\]](#_ftn20). Aside from his mother’s support of him in pursuing higher education, one of the most defining factors of Marco’s situation is how he has rationalized education as a solution to his family’s financial situation and, maybe, to his personal problems as well. With regards to the question of money, Marco had determined that he has “to be in uni if I want to have a comfortable future”. Not only that, but he also stated that it’s “very rare for bosses to hire based on sympathy based on your background”. Marco, similar to Cher and Hope, had framed education as a solution to his poverty. It is a way to find a job, to make a decent income, and to finally have a comfortable life that was taken away from him due to the divorce. However, Marco’s story introduces a new dimension to the idea of “education as a solution”. It is possible to postulate that education is not only Marco’s solution for his financial problems, but it is a way for him to fulfill his dreams and internalize certain unresolved emotional dilemmas as well. To put it shortly, education can assist Marco in realizing the qualities which he believed had been taken from him due to the separation, mainly logic, which he associates with masculinity. In sum, Marco would not lose his determination in completing his studies due to resource deprivation because it is his solution to resource deprivation; and additionally, it also aids him in achieving satisfaction with himself.

With regards to instability and emotional distress, as briefly mentioned previously, Marco has not fully resolved his emotional problems stemming from the divorce. However, despite the existence of these problems, Marco has prioritized education to such an extent that they do not seem to be interfering with his studies. In fact, the many emotional distresses engendered by the divorce might be factors which further concretize his conviction in the importance of education. Education is a way for Marco to mitigate his perceived lack of masculinity in the absence of his father. This has manifested itself in him choosing a field of studies which he believes place a focus on the masculine value of logic. By entering these programs and succeeding in them, Marco aims to convince himself that he does possess the logic that has been taken from him. It is important now to note that this link between emotional problem and education is an extrapolation based on the emotional distresses which he has detailed, and there is no explicit link drawn by the respondent. The specifics of Marco’s emotional turmoil would be further explored in Emotional Distress and Resilience.

*“I mean, that’s the way to get known in the world. Education. Then people will like notice you.”*

**iv.    Ray**

Ray’s parents got separated when he was four and he lived with his father, younger brother, and grandfather until recently. Ray’s financial situation could only be described as abject poverty. His father was a serial gambler, resulting in a large amount of debts. After he had gambled away the proceeds from the selling of their old flat, it was not possible to apply for rental housing with HDB due to various reasons. This meant that for certain periods of time, Ray had experienced living on the streets and sleeping on void decks; it is difficult to imagine any Singaporean living on the street, not to mention a child less than 10 years of age at the time. Even after Ray’s family had managed to pin down housing, he frequently experienced starvation and utility-cut-off. This is because his father continued to gamble and his grandfather was the only breadwinner of a household of four. Ray mused that after some time, you get used to eating less as you adapt to the starvation; this is a tell-tale sign of his household situation growing up.

*“We stay in a four-room flat, blackout, the water kena cut and everything, y'know, your utilities and everything, It's very very common. That time we don’t have a lot of food really. So, a lot of time we eat maggie mee lo. Just maggie mee all the way. Ya correct. Yea sometimes y'know, just a loaf of bread. Ya so...last time I was very very skinny, so abit, how to say, not very...err, adequately nourished la. So, starvation all these is common la I would say, it's very very common.”*

Aside from the extreme financial deprivation in which Ray lived for the better half of his life, he also seems to have lacked human and social capital when he was growing up. The lack of human capital is understandable as Ray does not see his father as an example of someone that he would ever follow. His grandfather, then, is the adult figure in his life; however, he does not seem to possess higher education as well. Additionally, his grandfather worked long hour as a cleaner to make ends meet. In this sense, Ray did not have any family member with significant educational attainment. Ray did not describe his experience in school or how close he was with other school-mates or teachers. All these factors in combination should mean that Ray is even more likely than others to quit schooling to try and find more revenue streams. In fact, Ray’s younger brother did turn to crime in order to earn some extra income, most likely allowances at their age at the time. Ray identified his involvement in criminal activities to address the “family need- need money mah. Correct. So, he joined them, they also do some stuff, got earn money also”. This raises the question as to why Ray did not resort to quitting school to try to earn extra money, not to mention engaging in criminal activities as his younger brother did. The clearest explanation for this is the fact that Ray found a way out of destitution in education; he believed in the effectiveness of education in opening a path towards financial sufficiency. “Along the way I realised, actually, education’s quite important.” Ray recalled the experiences of sleeping void decks and starvation as he stated that education was the only way to escape. What is significantly difficult to determine here is how he came to this conclusion.

*"So that’s when I realised that, actually, the first way out of it is definitely education. Yea. Not that it is a, uh- how to say, I view education more of as a form of discipline la. Yea, more than anything else, it’s just disciplines lor. We know that we may not apply what we all learned but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t put in more effort in- in- in wanting to- wanting to do well."*

Personally, Ray ascribed it to the fact that he was intrinsically motivated. But despite this vagueness at the beginning, Ray’s continued belief in education as a solution can be attributed to a certain extent that his effort was often directly translated into tangible results. When Ray tried his best to study, he was promoted from Normal Academic to Express after his first year of Secondary School. When he finished his O-level, his scores were not enough to enter his school of choice but that changed because he managed to convince the principal of his potential. After he had finished Junior College, he got offers from multiple firms offering scholarships. He eventually settled on a merit’s scholarship from the National University of Singapore Business School, a highly selective institution. It is clear, not only to interviewers but also to Ray, that he can see a clear translation of the amount of effort he puts into education and the acquisition of desired results. This is not to say that Ray never doubted his conviction due to the overwhelming burden of his financial deprivation. But he never gave up on it because he deeply believed that education can be a springboard for him to do more, it is not an end in of itself. Thus, by holding that education is a way out of poverty, Ray was able to socialize himself academically even in the absence of financial resources, human capital, and social capital.

*“I would say education is y'know, it's just, it's just a something I- I- I- I need to have la. Something that was good to...I- I- I- was not, need- need- need to have la - err good to have ah, and everything. But my focus is more on y'know, building businesses out there y’know, investing more, how to- to- to develop my skill sets. My practical skill sets. To me, that is my motivation”*

Ray did not mention any effect of the instability and stress of the separation on him. This can be attributed to the fact that Ray was very young when the separation happened and he does not have many memories of his mother. Most of Ray’s stress would probably be from the extreme resource deprivation he experienced as a child. Thus, Ray experienced instability and stress rather indirectly compared to the other three respondents in this sample. Thus, he is completely inconsistent with the Instability and Stress camp.

**v.    Summary**

The biggest link between these four cases is that, in the absence of the numerous nuances, they all overcame the resource deprivation engendered by single-parenthood by internalizing education as a solution to that deprivation. The Instability and Stress camp appears salient in three out of the four cases but it is overshadowed by the internalization of education or was rather muted in its effect. This can be explained by the fact that education could have been so paramount as a purpose that the distress did not affect it as much as it did the various other facets of the participants’ lives. Unfortunately, it was not possible to ascertain the consistencies of cases against the Selection Camp as the interviews severely lack information on the characteristics of the parents of the ACOSP and their spousal relationships. This has led to a new synthesis of the causal chains based on the actual experience of these ACOSP.

### **c.   Recommendations**

Recommendations are framed with regards to two actors: Schools and the State

For the Schools, the clearest objective is to concretize the web of social relations which would keep COSP in school and make them feel integrated into an academic environment. Furthermore, it cannot be stated sufficiently that COSP must be able to see the result of their education in order to actually internalize it. If education comes off only as another cost on their family’s overburden finances, it is unlikely social networks would work:

-   Mentorship system: A mentoring system, as described by Hope, appears to be highly helpfl in establishing teacher-students bond. This is important as the teacher can not only provide COSP with academic guidance but also advise and support while keeping an eye out for problems at home. Due to single parents’ shortage of time, the teacher as a mentor can play a part in filling that human and social capital gap.

-   Merits/Effort-based Financial Rewards: Something schools can adopt is to reward the effort and merits of students from low-income backgrounds. This doesn’t have to be focused directly on COSP but they would naturally fall into this group. These rewards can be token in nature or in the forms of financial assistance. This financial assistance should be awarded on top of the bursaries they already have access. Though the bursaries do not have to be large, rewarding them would give students the impression that their effort in education is paying off.

For the State, the focus should be on the expansion of existing services which could aid parents who do not have the time to help in the academic socialization of their children. The most notable of this is the Student Care Centres which take care of school-age children. The Student Care Fee Assistance scheme is a great way to help COSP in low-income households to have the interactions they need to be adequately socialized. This scheme should further be expanded to take into consideration the working hour of parents as well aside from income. This would entail the creation of a unit which aims to take care of children beyond the normal operating hours, ideally until 20:30 or 21:00. It would allow parents who do not have a flexible work arrangements to accommodate their schedule to better-paying work or more shifts while keeping children off the street or at home alone, unsupervised.

## **4.  Romantic Relationships**

### **a.   Literature review**

Though it might be enlightening to simply consider how ACOSP form and maintain their regular relationships, i.e. friendships, by looking at romantic relationships, it would allow for a deeper delve into how ACOSP handle the most intimate relationships in their life. Furthermore, as the cause of separation is often divorce, looking at romantic relationships could paint a picture of how the separation event has affected ACOSP deep into their adulthood. It could also provide us with a picture of how they approach conflicts in romantic relationships, a great indicator of how functional their approach to romantic relationships is. There are no available statistics as to the inter-generational transmission of divorce in Singapore but through these qualitative interviews, it may be possible to peek at that hypothesized linkage. But most important of all, the ability to form and maintain romantic relationships is one of the major indicators as to the quality of lives in adulthood and late-adulthood as it entails what type of companionship one would expect to have. In this regard, evaluating the romantic relationship of ACOSP might provide hints about their future well-being and quality of lives, delineating one clear causal mechanism between the separation event and future happiness in life.

Because of these reasons, the romantic relationships of ACOSP is a well-studied topic, qualitatively and quantitatively. There is a seeming consensus in the literature that single-parent headed families, primarily created through divorce but other painful separation might apply, do not imbue children with trust in the institution of marriage or romantic relationships. Their experience growing up in such families cultivates their scepticism of long-term relationships, and, generally, increase the likelihood of them getting divorced if they decide to get married. However, a part of the literature has outlined how the outcomes aren’t always so stark. They argue that even if their perception of romantic relationships is changed, it doesn’t mean that they would not be so incapable of forming and maintaining relationships as some earlier works detailed. The most difficult aspect of the literature to verify is that mediating factors are often not clearly delineated from each other, making it significantly more difficult to discern the causal effect of each factor.

The research synthesized here focuses overwhelmingly on children of divorce, limiting its generalization to other types of single-parent headed households. From this literature, there are two general explanations as to why children of divorce have a reduced ability to form and maintain romantic relationships: ACOSP have a reduced capacity to love due to modeling after their parents, and ACOSP have a reduced capacity to love due to their fear of or warped perception of relationships and marriage. These two schools are not mutually exclusive, in fact, they are definitely related with factors interacting with each other. However, there are important differences between them which would have implications for case analysis.

In the case of ACOSP having a reduced capacity to love due to modelling, the principal assumption is that children will base their style of attachment based on what they observe of their parents’ relationship and behaviour as well as their relationship with their parents. This is in part based on Attachment Theory developed by Ainsworth (1940). Separation, especially divorce, represents a major disruption in familial relationships which could leave the child vulnerable and confused. Additionally, due to the drastic change in the relationship of their parents, particularly during divorce proceedings, children might adjust their expectation of relationships to be more accurate accordingly to their own personal situations. In their landmark study, Wallerstein and Lewis (2004) showed using 25-year worth of qualitative data that ACOSP often fail in the romantic endeavours due to their fear of repeating their parents’ mistakes. More specifically, they often do not how to conduct themselves in relationships and what sort of behaviours would be accepted in a healthy relationship[\[21\]](#_ftn21). Furthermore, their experience has given ACOSP a fear of conflict, or at least an aversion to confronting problems within the relationships, as this is instinctively linked to the arguments their parents had. This would result in the fact that ACOSP would not express themselves well in relationships and handle conflicts sufficiently. For example, an ACOSP might not be able to provide the sufficient level of emotional or physical support which his/her partner requires as gestures of affection were not present in his/her past. When conflict arises, an ACOSP might choose to ignore or flee from it rather than work it out in a constructive manner with his/her partner, fearing the reliving of past conflicts or the dissolution of the relationship[\[22\]](#_ftn22). Presumably, this inability to perform effectively in relationships is symptomatic of a larger issue of their reduced capacity to form and maintain long-term relationships in general.

![](images/clipboard-2361553838.png)

The second explanation as to why ACOSP might not perform effectively in relationshipss is their warped view of romantic relationships and marriage. However, the warped view of relationship and marriage is not homogenous among ACOSP, in fact, it would be more accurate to say they are polarized. A certain group ACOSP would have an almost irrational fear of the dissolution of marriage and relationships. This seems intuitive as they fear the prospects of repeating their parents’ mistakes. But beyond that, ACOSP who witnessed how one parent suffered from the abusive nature or infidelity of the other parent would be extremely wary of following their parent’s patterns. This is further exacerbated if the ACOSP was kept in the dark about why the separation happened, intensifying the fear that it might happen to them. Even when adult children accept that their parents made the reasonable decision to pursue a divorce, they still view it as a model of what to avoid, or a failure they fear they would repeat in their own lives[\[23\]](#_ftn23). They apply these fears to reality by being hyper-wary when picking out potential partners. As one respondent noted to Cartwright (2006), they would only look for partners who are willing to be in it for the long-term. Or, these fears might manifest in paranoia about their partner, fearing they might leave at any moment, fearing they might cheat. As one woman recounted to Wallerstein and Lewis (2004), she still remembers vividly how her father had left her, as she fears any of her partners would leave her in the same fashion. This warped view of marriage and relationship leads to the fear that their relationships, or marriage, might end at any moment even if there is evidence to the contrary[\[24\]](#_ftn24). Such omnipresent fear could lead ACOSP to prematurely end the relationship in order to avoid the pain of being abandoned. On the other hand, there exists a contingent of ACOSP who does not identify with this fear, rather, they feel that divorce and separation are par for the course and are acceptable solutions to a relationship[\[25\]](#_ftn25). The danger here lies in the fact that these ACOSP tend to put less effort into maintaining relationships as they would rather resort to dissolution. They have a less idealistic view of marriage, lower expectations for relationships as well as view divorce as an acceptable option if the situation arises.

![](images/clipboard-3302261316.png)

In order to effectively analyze cases, it is extremely difficult to make clear-cut distinctions between these two schools of thought due to their inter-connectivity. For example, the fear of dissolution can interfere with how an ACOSP conduct him- or herself in a relationship. Similarly, it can be argued that the parental relationship model is the reason why the fear of dissolution would exist. However, it is important to note that these schools can exist independent of each other as well, which is why they are separated. During analysis, however, it would be more fruitful to consider them in unison in order to determine whether connectivity exists, rather than assuming they are independent in each case.

### **b.   Analysis**

The respondents in the sample correspond to both schools of thoughts to certain extents. The circumstances in their lives which are consistent or inconsistent with the two chains provide bountiful information as to mechanisms which facilitate such results. Furthermore, the samples present instances which have not been mentioned extensively in the literature. These scenarios occur when ACOSP perception of romantic relationship did not result as a direct consequence of the divorce but rather through a series of factors initiated by the separation event. The degree of disconnect between these factors and the separation is high enough to categorize these cases as a new type which have not been addressed in the literature, most likely due to their frequency of occurrence.

**i.    Cher**

Cher’s parents have had a great impact on her, as she can still clearly feel the trauma in just remembering this time period. The trauma was displayed in Cher’s recounting as well as her tonal shift when the subject came up. “It was very traumatizing to me. Now like, if, whenever I pass Chinatown, it would remind of that period lah. So, it was quite horrible in a sense.” Cher based some of her perceptions of romantic relationships on her parents’, primarily when she stated that she would avoid partner who resembles her father in personality. Additionally, Cher could clearly observe that her parents’ relationships are arduous and conflict-prone. Her parents went through an acrimonious divorce, indicating that their married lives were most likely not healthy. Post-separation, the onus remains as Cher described.

“But my mom and dad cannot be in the same room even second. Like, they cannot even- they cannot even look at each other. That’s how much it affected their relationship, you know.”

Furthermore, Cher’s fear of repeating her parents’ mistakes are highly noticeable as she is “afraid of separation and… like I just don’t want it to happen you know, I just don’t want break ups and everything". She in no way believes that divorce or dissolution is normal as suggested by some of the literature.

“Because like, I wouldn’t want what happened to my mum and my dad happen to me also.”

Yet, the factors of not having a healthy relationship model and the fear of dissolution should be sufficient to influence Cher to possess unhealthy behaviours in romantic relationships or warped perceptions of them. Cher’s case is, in fact, consistent with the element of being picky with partners in order to avoid a parent’s characteristics and to prevent dissolution. However, it would be erroneous to categorize Cher as consistent with dysfunctional approach toward relationships or a debilitating fear of dissolution which might interfere with relationships.

At this point, it is important to recognize that Cher has not been in a romantic relationship before due to her conservative religious environment, which greatly reduces her chance of interacting with the opposite sex; it might be possible that her approach and behaviours might diverge from her self-reporting in this interview. Nevertheless, for the purpose of analysis, it should be assumed that her sentiments here are accurate.

Cher's model of romantic relationships involves an open communication style of problem-solving as well as the necessity for compromises, hallmarks of a progressive relationship style. Not only that, she mentioned a poignant point about the need to accept the flaws of others, emphasizing that it is not possible for people to be completely perfect. This recognition shows that Cher is ready to discuss problems and adjust herself to the flaws of her partner, realizing that confrontation is necessary to resolve differences, but dissolution is not the only end to conflicts in the relationship. Even though Cher had stated that she would avoid those who resemble her dad, she clarified that it was mostly due to what she knows about him. With regards to the flaws in her partner, she would like to remain open and willing to accept their flaws rather than breaking off quickly and easily.

“And then, it’s when you talk right, you would know their flaws. And once you know their flaws, and you accept them right, because knowing is not enough you have to accept them you know, because sometimes these flaws are, they’re not- it’s not easy to change lah. So, you have to accept them for who they are, I feel.”

The reason why Cher does not seem to possess dysfunctional behaviour or an irrational fear for relationships is most likely due to her relationships with her parents, especially her mother. One of the pivotal points in Cher’s story is how she was able to openly communicate with her mother about the divorce and most everything after a critical juncture. Through this experience, she learned and accepted why the divorce happened and she began to view her mom and dad as human beings with flaws, specifically for her father. Cher could adopt an open-minded approach towards her potential partners as well as avoid the fear of sudden dissolution precisely because she knows why exactly the divorce has happened and how it won’t happen to her in that same manner. For a brief period of time, Cher believed she had understood why her mother had pursued the divorce. This doubt was clarified by her mother with patience and in details. This turn of event had enabled Cher to embrace the benefits of open communication in relationships.

Thus, Cher’s embrace of open communication is vital to explaining how she was able to overcome the effects of the separation, despite the fact that they still affect her emotionally and psychologically, she still rationalized that her parents’ relationships don’t have to resemble her own and how the causes of the divorce are specific to her parents and are justified. This is consistent with Cartwright’s suggestion that open communication can be a major driver for overcoming the consequences of divorce on COSP’s ideation of romantic relationships[\[26\]](#_ftn26). In this sense, her ideation of romantic relationships could have been directly affected by the separation event but it was intervened by the occurrence of open communication.

**ii.    Hope**

Hope’s case is largely inconsistent with the literature presented here because she experienced the separation event through her father passing away rather than through divorce or legal separation. Thus, even if she had based her relationship style based on her that of her parents’, it would not be explained by the divorce literature. However, her perception of romantic relationships, and even normal relationships in general has been affected by the passing of her father to some extent. The subject of discussion, then, would be how the passing of a loved one can shape ACOSP’s perception of romantic relationships. It is equally important to consider this as it has been shown that ACOSP created through a parent’s passing do experience many of the same disadvantages that ACOSP created through separation or divorce.

The most noticeable way in which Hope’s father passing has manifested itself in her psyche is how she has grown more fearful of losing her loved ones. The loss of her father has impacted greatly how she approaches her relationship with others. When asked if she had changed her approach in relationships, she answered:

“I think yes, like you view things as more important. Less disposable. Like maybe last time you were like...I was like, if you break up, then it’s fine lah! Just find somebody else. But now you are more like...What if tomorrow y’know, this person like, won’t be here.”

Clearly, Hope has become more fearful of dissolution indirectly because of her father’s passing. She is afraid of ending a relationship because she linked the fear of not seeing someone again, i.e. via breaking up, with the fear that she will never see them again, a fear of the unknown engendered by her father’s passing. Fear has also forced her to revisit how she deal with conflicts in a relationship. She had moved from a more aggressive, resolute approach to a more compromising and open-minded, acknowledging her own faults, style of conflict resolution. The basis for this change is rooted in how she is afraid of losing a loved one accidentally, something she believes she will regret, whether there is evidence or not that such an event might happen.

"Last time I’m more hot-headed. Like I want to resolve it immediately you know! If me and you, we argue then, then I will be like... I kind of want you to say sorry, but for now, I’ll be like, I’ll sit down and think of a while and if I feel that I am in the wrong then I will come and say sorry"

Though Hope's romantic relationships might not be shaped by the same factors that would affect children of divorce, her father's passing definitely has shaped the way she approaches a relationship. Thus, Hope can still be categorized as being directly affected by the separation event, albeit in a very different manner from Cher.

**iii.    Marco**

Marco’s interview did not provide enough details to judge whether he bases his approach to romantic relationships based on that of his parents. There was only one instance where he stated that he does not know how to conduct himself or what is to be done in a relationship as “I didn’t think of that. I didn’t know of that. I didn’t know that that could be a way… that could, show affection.” Thus, to a certain extent, the divorce has stripped Marco of a functional relationship model, consistent with the literature’s predictions. However, Marco presents a much clearer case of how an ACOSP’s approach to romantic relationships might be shaped by the fallout of divorce indirectly.

An important factor for Marco’s case is the fact that he was severely affected by the fallout of the separation in his family life. This has damaged his emotional and psychological well-being greatly. Marco had described his family life as a broken “circle of love” and how he felt that his parents have failed by not supplying him with enough emotional support. The theme of being insufficiently provided for emotionally surfaces many times during Marco’s interview. The most noteworthy aspect of this sentiment is Marco’s perception that he used to lack the traits which a masculine figure would normally provide, i.e. a father figure. Because of his habitation with his mother, Marco found that he was more effeminate due to the “tender loving care” traits passed down by his mother. In other words, he lacks the pragmatism and logical thinking of men. It culminated in him being stigmatized and bullied by friends at school, not for his status as a COSP but for his effeminate characteristics.

*“And growing up in school, because I only live with my mum, so like, psychologically growing up with both parents they teach you both sides of mindsets and values. Going to school, other people dissed me, called me gay, or called me like, different, I don’t know like, I can’t remember, can’t remember.”*

After these incidents, Marco described how he had lost faith in friendship for a period of time, making him doubt himself and those around him. The betrayal of his closest friends had shaken how he viewed his relationship with others. His fear of exposing his vulnerable aspects to other in combination with the fact that he aimed to become more pragmatic and masculine meant that Marco chose to close himself off from others, not revealing too much about himself or his emotions. It became apparent when he described the problems he faced in romantic relationships.

*“But with that, I guess I short-change my emotional reserves a lot. So, like, during then my girlfriend would say, why are you so closed up? Why are you so closed up in your affection? I guess that growing up because of the divorce, and maybe especially during working in the cinema, those years, then I felt like there was the absence of my dad at home that I learnt to shut down my emotions a lot. Like not feeling anything is better than feeling emotions, or feeling worse, or feeling depressed. So, I think, that carried on to my relationship and that was quite evident because I would like not give in as much”*

There are more nuances here about how Marco had tried to compensate for the absence of his father, but they would be discussed further in Emotional Distress and Resilience. Marco’s romantic relationships have suffered from his inability to share his emotions, which is an indirect result of his parents’ separation. The consequence of this is clear as he further emphasized: “I just couldn’t think of how to express emotions. Yeah, I just, I couldn’t think of any way to express emotions.” It created problems as he refused to expose his vulnerabilities even in a romantic relationship which require the disclosure of stronger emotions. Marco's inability to express his emotions and his lack of experience with practices in a healthy romantic relationship could become major barriers in maintaining a long-term relationship. Thus, Marco’s experience in romantic relationships suffers as an indirect, and to some extent direct as well, result of his parents’ separation.

**iv.    Ray**

For Ray, one of the most remarkable aspects is the fact that he seems relatively unaffected by the direct fallout of the separation. There are two possible reasons for this. Firstly, he was not close to his mother, as he put it: “We don’t really talk much also lah. Yea. So most recently when I connect a bit ah, you know. Yea, but, to me, it’s just like that ah.” Secondly, Ray’s dislike of his father is immense as much of the resource deprivation Ray has experienced is attributed to him. Thus, Ray does not have any quandary about the cause of the separation or is he particularly affected by the separation itself. Nevertheless, the separation and his family situation did deprive him of a healthy romantic relationship model. Ray relied on himself and circumstances to form his approach in judging, forming, and maintaining relationships with others, including romantic relationships; therefore, any dysfunctionalities or abnormalities in Ray’s perception of romantic relationships is likely an indirect result of the separation. More specifically, they result from the resource deprivation Ray went through due to his father’s gambling.

Ray's conception of romantic relationships was not based on the relationship of his parents but rather on the circumstances in which he lived and his relationship with his father. Throughout the interview, Ray mentions a lot about having value or being valuable to someone else.

*"To become better than them. If you’re of no value to other people right, why would they want to interact with you?"*

One cause for this might be the fact he views his father as useless who could not provide and landed the family into abject poverty. Furthermore, Ray had personally heard his friends’ parents advising them not to play with him due to his family situations. Personally, he attributed it to the fact he did not have value as a person, therefore, he is not worth being acquainted with. For Ray, having value to others is everything. Values manifest itself to him by being of use to others, precisely what his father could not accomplish for his family; it is the reason why Ray referred to his father as “useless”. Thus, in romantic relationships, Ray firmly believes in the idea of having “value” for your partner. In the case given to use, he focuses much more on making sure he has enough value to become desirable to others.

*"Ya lo cause if you’re not serious, you won’t even want to be with someone who have no y’know, immediate value to you. I would use the word “immediate value” la. Cause being with us, y'know, it's a potential game. Y'know, im buying into your potential. That’s all. You have nothing now that can value add me. Correct, from a female point of view la. That’s what I would think. Ya, y'know, being with you is buying into your potential next time. Ya."*

In addition to this obsession with “value”, Ray did not mention the concept of "being loved", or as he put it "puppy love" when he describes what he desired or looked for. He seems to conceive relationshipss as having values to offer the other person. Not only that, it is clear that his specific outlook on romantic relationship is focused on the idea of stability and the potential of establishing a stable household, free from destitution. Any emotion-guided endeavour would risk landing him back in the material poverty he has detested. The resource deprivation he had experienced casts a long shadow onto every aspect of his life, including in how he approaches his romantic relationships. Though this is not dysfunctional, it only means that Ray views relationships as a vessel of stability rather than of passion and emotions. Ray looks for a person who would help him achieve his ambition and build his ideal household while he would reciprocate those actions.

*"So, I would say it's more of...relationship to me is more of like y'know, more of a stable err, partnership. Like for the long run. It's not much more of the thrill and all, or all those err, fleeting one. Those those- those kinds of err, puppy love those kinds of things. Yea correct, because, because ya lo cause I have- have to be honest also, because we don’t have the economic ability la, to sustain this kind of relationship also"*

Even though Ray's conception of romantic relationships is very different, or utilitarian, it's not unhealthy as far as we can tell. He often focuses on himself when discussing the need to have enough value, though he emphasized that he would prefer if his partner has goals and works as well. His need for a stable partnership rather than wanton passion seems reasonable in the context of his resource-deprived experience growing up and, as far as we can tell, it’s not dysfunctional. Furthermore, he has been in a long-term relationship since Secondary School, may be proving that the way he approaches relationships is working for him and his particular context. However, this analysis would not be completely substantiated if we cannot judge how Ray’s partner feel about their current approach to the relationship.

Thus, even though Ray’s approach to romantic relationships appear insulated from the fallout of the separation, it has definitely been indirectly affected due to his relationship with his father and the extreme resource deprivation caused by his father.

**v.    Summary**

It is difficult to stress how nuanced each of the cases is with regards to their ideation of romantic relationships. It is precisely because the separation often has such complicated fallout that there are numerous factors and intricacies which have not been mentioned or were not captured in the interviews. To capture a person’s conception of one of the most intimate and vulnerable aspects of their lives has proved to be arduous even with a good instrument. Thus, there are only two broad types which could be identified by this analysis: those who are clearly directly affected by the separation, Cher and Hope, and those who are indirectly affected by it, Marco and Ray. The visualization of this, however, is complex as many factors which are the result of the indirect effect could link back to the factors in direct effect before it reaches a shared conclusion (Figure 2). Therefore, to assert that each case could completely fit perfectly into one type would be erroneous.

### **c.    Recommendations**

In order to ensure parents’ open communication and the resolution of deeper-rooted issues which affect COSP’s romantic relationships, the recommendations are focused on two main groups: Parents and Children.

For Parents, it is very important to propagate the idea that it is important to discuss with your child about the causes of the divorce and what it means for the family, no matter how difficult the conversation may appear. Though this is not something that can be enforced easily, the education of parents to reinforce this desired behaviour is possible. It could be mandated as part of divorce proceedings or as a pre-requisite to receiving custodial rights. By having them undergo a class which layout the importance as well as the approach of discussing this topic, the government can improve the chances of them actually having these talks. In order to reduce the burden on government resources, these courses can be outsourced to VWOs which would appreciate the chance to come in contact with single parents, giving them the chance to introduce other programs as well. However, the materials for these courses have already been created and are available on the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s website.

For children, the greatest help they could receive is in terms of Counselling. Even though Marco mentioned that he did receive counselling, it was not as helpful because he was young. Thus, any Counselling program which hope to succeed would have to track the status of COSP with time in 3- or 5-year interval, and at important junctures (PSLE, O-level, etc.). By following up with the child, counsellors could help them tackle deep-rooted problems and the problems they face in romantic relationships. This could potentially help them tackle dysfunctional behaviours in general and in relationships as well. Such programs could be effectively carried out by agencies such as CCs or VWOs with local chapters which possess decentralized resources capable of maintaining a counselling relationship on a number of COSP.

## **5.  Emotional Distress and Resilience**

### **a.   Literature Review**

Resilience denotes the ability to recover to a pre-crisis mental state after undergoing a crisis situation[\[27\]](#_ftn27). For the purpose of this analysis, resilience can be understood more broadly to denote the ability to persevere through the crisis situation and return to the pre-crisis mental state. Emotional distress, on the other hand, entails feelings of sadness, dread, anger, stress, or any other emotions which might interfere strongly with thoughts or even the carrying out of activities in a normal daily life setting.

The literature for Resilience and Emotional Distress are separate from each other as they study different phenomena. It is not fruitful to try and group them together under the same umbrella as Resilience resembles an ability or a possessed trait while Emotional Distress denotes a felt or lived experience. Thus, the purpose of this analysis is more to bring attention to the fact that the literature has established that these two phenomena are co-existing. Interestingly, even when ACOSP are resilient, meaning they have developed adequate coping strategies or garner the necessary requisites to become resilient, they still often experience more distress than an adult who grew up in a traditional nuclear family. In other words, they are equipped psychologically and emotionally to handle difficult situations, yet they are still much more vulnerable to frequent internal distress than the regular person.

Resilience entails the competent functioning of children after exposure to adversity, even when psychopathy was expected. Specifically, it means competent functioning in some domain (such as social or work relationship) even after undergoing extremely risky ordeals which often invoke dysfunctional behaviour[\[28\]](#_ftn28). In order to analyse it more effectively, resilience can be broken down into three more specific components in what is known as the Self-determination Theory. These three components include[\[29\]](#_ftn29):

1.     Autonomy: This component entails how much one views that one has control over one’s own actions. It consists of the conception that you are in control of your choices and actions. In other words, it means to feel choiceful.

2.     Competence: The need for competence can be described as the desire to see the results of your actions, specifically the positive results of your actions. With competence, one can find that there are rules to the environment, there is a structure to life. Thus, any action should have a reasonable and expected reaction.

3.     Relatedness: The self-determination theory defines Relatedness as the need to form meaningful relationships with others. It predicts that human beings want to feel that they belong and connected to others around them.

The fulfilment of these three needs is vital to acquiring and developing resilience. Divorce, or other separation events, poses the greatest risk when it has the potential to interfere with a person’s pursuit to fulfil these three needs, thus leading to maladjustment. However, children of divorce can often overcome these risks and strive for normal adjustment, contrary to common belief[\[30\]](#_ftn30). COSP often possess good resilience due to their fulfilment of three needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence. The subsequent acquisition of resilience can lead to motivation for personal growth and self-betterment. By identifying and trying to fulfil these needs actively, children of divorce attain resilience. Most notable of this would be autonomy or the way COSP chose to reframe and to understand the event of a divorce in a manner which would let them move forward, leveraging their choicefulness to better their own life[\[31\]](#_ftn31). However, resilience and self-determination theory cannot be easily achieved by the individual alone. Rather, it isa result of the interactions of numerous factors. The most important factors identified are intra-family support, family support, support of friends, and open communication. Noticeably, these factors place importance on social support much more than individual hardiness or determination[\[32\]](#_ftn32). It can be seen that these factors are often social in nature while COSP often lacks social capital greatly.

Even though ACOSP display great resilience in terms of their speed and level of adjustments to a new environment, this resilience did not seem to reduce their level of experienced distress. This is peculiar as greater adjustments, especially in terms of high level of social responsibility and low level of modelling your actions based on the standards of others (other-direction), often correlates negatively with experienced distress. Yet, ACOSP were shown to have the same if not more emotional distress than others from traditional families[\[33\]](#_ftn33). ACOSP, though resilient, experience distress in a variety of matters including their complicated and unresolved feelings toward their fathers or mothers, their feeling of loss after the divorce, their negative perception of their childhood, and other painful trauma-related directly or indirectly to separation[\[34\]](#_ftn34). The dual existence of Resilience and Emotional Distress should be examined to determine whether the factors which contribute to one might contribute to the other. The examination of these two phenomena could also help bring about a deeper understanding of how COSP continue to function to successfully reach adulthood while still harbouring deep internal turmoil.

### **b.   Analysis**

**i.    Cher**

In order to establish whether Cher had felt emotional distress, there are certain examples from the interview which can shed some light.

*"To me like, because my parents got divorced when I was. Six. Ok wait, I remember vaguely, but I know like when I was in Primary One, I had to go to the court a lot. Because my parents were fighting for custody over me and my siblings. So, at seven, can you imagine going to the court? So, it was very traumatizing to me. Now like, if, whenever I pass Chinatown, it would remind of that period lah. So, it was quite horrible in a sense"*

In addition to describing the divorce as traumatizing, Cher also noted that the event is no longer sad for her, but remembering it still brings back certain trauma. The divorce disrupted Cher’s household greatly and she witnessed how it affected her younger sister, combining to create a mixture of quiet suffering and sadness. Furthermore, when Cher was younger, she was afraid that she might be abandoned, including by her friends; these fears most likely emerged from the confusion surrounding the cause of the divorce, the separation of her father, and the absence of her mother due to work. However, Cher was able to mitigate the emotional distress when she initiated communication with her mother; it has helped her understand the cause of the divorce while gaining a deeper relationship with her mother. Therefore, some of the deep-rooted reasons for her distress were addressed thanks to this open communication.

Cher’s completion of the components in the self-determination theory is sufficient to achieve Resilience.

1.     **Autonomy**: Aside from asking her to do chores, Cher's mother is generally supportive of her decisions and open to her opinions. Cher does not seem to feel pressured by her mother as she has made choices which are definitely radical considering her circumstances. She made the choice to go to Poly and to go to a regular university. She made the choice to study as much as she did.

a.     *"I told her that I don’t like to be compared with another, like, kid from school. Since then like she won’t- she stopped comparing me and now whenever I feel like I need- I’m gonna do badly for a test, she’s gonna tell me it’s ok, instead of comparing me with another person.”*

2.     **Competence**: Cher can see clearly how her efforts in studying translate to tangible benefits to her and her family. This is clearest in the fact that the school had waived her tuition fees multiple times informally due to her good results. Not only this, when she expressed her opinions to her mother, it was clear to her that she had been heard.

a.     *"But, why do I stay, or why didn’t they kick me out, is because I got good grades. I feel like if I didn’t get good grades, they would kick me out. I honestly feel that. Because we are really, there was one time we didn’t pay for an entire year. And I remember, I got my O Level cert, or rather, my final exam for Secondary 4. Oh wait, sorry, primary school. PSLE. I got my PSLE and my report book for Primary 6 when I was in Sec One, like a year later. Because I couldn’t, because for them the policy is if you don’t pay the school fees, you cannot your report book. But the funny thing is, they knew I would pass lah, so they would just bring me over to the next level, which is Sec One."*

3.     **Relatedness**: Cher definitely feels a closeness to not only her friends but also her family. She is special in this sample in that she feels especially open to her parents, being willing to share many things with them.

a.     *"If you’re talking about like a person that I talk to, you have to remember that I am in the same school as my friends of ten years. So definitely I would go to them. For us, we are really like a family."*

b.     *"So, uh, I guess like because the culture is very close-knit right, the teachers and everyone tend to help each other.”*

Cher has attained Resilience to certain substantial extents. It was put to the test when she was thrown into the Polytechnic environment and in close working proximity with male schoolmates, something she has not experienced before. As Cher described it, she broke down due to this culture show. However, she was able to overcome this as well after sometimes, integrating herself into the co-ed environment effectively after over 10 years of not having to do so.

The result of Cher’s survey on happiness and self-efficacy return no noteworthy results except for the fact that she does not seem to possess a healthy amount of self-efficacy. She chose 60% of the statements which indicate a lack of control over one’s life circumstances. her self-efficacy is most likely limited by the fact that she is still in school and her tuition, or to a larger extent her family financial situation, is still out of her sphere of influence.

**ii.    Hope**

Hope did not experience a divorce or separation but the emotional trauma and distress engendered by the passing of a loved one cannot be discounted. It was very clear that the passing of her father affected her greatly. Not only that, her mother and sister reaction to his passing was another burden on her emotional state. Even as she describes her experience to the interviewers, her tone of voice was not stable. This grief seems immense though it happened long ago. Hope’s language emphasized the suddenness and finality of his passing, expressing her regrets that she did not spend enough time with him when he was alive; interestingly, this was also present in the discussion of her approach to romantic relationships.

*“And I think he was in a lot of pain but he didn’t show at all. He just continued going to work every day, yea, until he really couldn’t. I think the liver failed so he started to swell up and really cannot walk already. That’s when he, like, just went to hospital and never came out.”*

*“Only when I grew older, studied more, you know, you understand how things work then, ok, he was there, he was always there, just that he couldn’t be physically there. This is when you realize this kind of thing- it’s too late actually, to understand that.”*

Hope’s completion of the components of the self-determination theory is sufficient. However, similar to Cher, her self-efficacy also suffers from her financial dependence on others to pay for her tuition, bills, and other expenses.

1.     **Autonomy**: There is no indication that Hope feels her actions and choices are being dictated to her, in fact, her independence is one of her defining features. She chose to study hard for her O level. She chose to try to stay at home. She chose to try to become the emotional pillar for her family. She chose the specific major she wants to study at university.

a.     *"And then I- I felt like I had the duty to- the obligation to be like what my father was for her, which was actually very stressful. Because, um, I cannot replace him, of course. And then, my sister was very immature. She didn’t- I feel like she didn’t see things the way I saw. And then, she was just in her own world, still at her rebellious time. Even though she was three years older. So, like, I felt like I had to take more responsibility than- my sister should probably have taken. But, ultimately, I was just closer to my mom. I just accompanied her to things that she wants to do, yea, and help around the house or something"*

2.     **Competence**: The only indication of competence which is identifiable within Hope's interview is the fact that when she studied hard, she got good results for O-level. However, Hope's lack of competence, or self-efficacy, is much clearer. Similar to Cher, being a university student, her expensive tuition fee and her inability to contribute to paying it is a major impairment on her competence. This is partly supported by the fact that she chose 80% of statements which indicate a lack of self-efficacy.

a.     *"So, just sometimes, occasionally, when we go to the bank right and she withdraws money then I’m like: “How much do we have left?” She doesn’t like to say so, um- but I know, sometimes right, I accidentally peeked at the number, right, it goes down"*

3.     **Relatedness**: Hope receives great support and connects well with others especially her close friends and her boyfriend. She does not seem to have a problem with regards to establishing relationships with others.

a.     *“I think I had quite a bit of, uh, support from my friends, so it’s ok. My friends would study with me.”*

Hope displays perseverance in the retelling of her experience. From trying to be the emotional support for her mother to seeking out opportunities when she failed to get into university. Thus, she possesses the ability to bounce back from adversity despite the underlying grief which she experiences from her father’s passing.

**iii.    Marco**

As previously mentioned, Marco faces problems with regards to how he connects with other people and how he maintains his relationships. Not only that, it was very clear that the divorce still has a lot of residual impact on his life. It has seeped into how he views himself and how he has made decisions in his life. Marco felt that he had missed out on the familial love which others possess, specifically the love of his father who did not keep in contact. His perception that he missed out on his father’s love was further concretized when he observed fathers with their sons bonding during his part-time job as a cinema attendant. Furthermore, Marco rationalized this loss of fatherly affection into a character deficiency; he believes strongly that he was not taught how to be logical and pragmatic due to his father’s absence, painfully absent masculinity. This deprivation led to him being bullied by his close friends for his perceived effeminate features. It had led him to choose fields of studies and shaped his personality in a way that he believes would make up for this deficiency and protect his emotional vulnerabilities from further betrayal.

With regards to the self-determination theory, it is difficult to determine Marco’s possession of the components. It seems, from limited evidence, that he does have Autonomy and Competence. However, his Relatedness is sorely lacking.

1.     **Autonomy**: Marco does not seem to find that he is restrained and he does not think he is restrained by anyone in terms of his decision-making. The most significant manifestation of Autonomy in his life is him choosing to compensate for his perceived lack of logic and his choice of university major based on his innate desire.

a.     *“I’ve had more feminine essence, but I offset with my logical thinking, pragmatism”*

b.     *“So um, you know, studying accounting and finance would enable me and equip me, not just for myself but for other people outside as well.”*

2.     **Competence**: Marco's competence is difficult to determine. The only probable evidence is the fact that he said he had received monetary rewards for his study which reinforced the links between education and success for him.

a.     *“Because every time you do well, there’s like those awards, you get those monetary awards. Like, \$200, \$300. And like, this amount that I get is usually transferred to like give to the house, or pay the bills”*

3.     **Relatedness**: Marco's connections to those around him are difficult to describe, but it appears that they are not good, or at least not substantive. Marco's family is not close to each other and the affection being displayed is mostly through a family dinner. Marco does not seem to share his inner turmoil with his mother. Marco's reservation is understandable due to a traumatic experience in his past with his friends. However, it seems that Marco was able to open up to his church friends which helped him express his feelings. He still finds it difficult to open up to his friends, even his partner, as vulnerabilities are difficult for him to express out of fear of repeating the past.

a.     *“Then when I started selling tickets to dads with their sons, going to the movie theatres, then I realized that I’m missing out so much. Yeah, like time with my dad”*

b.     *“I guess that growing up because of the divorce, and maybe especially during working in the cinema, those years, then I felt like there was the absence of my dad at home that I learnt to shut down my emotions a lot. Like not feeling anything is better than feeling emotions, or feeling worse, or feeling depressed. So, I think, that carried on to my relationship and that was quite evident because I would like not give in as much. Or because, I just don’t know how, to give in as much. It just wasn’t practised in the family, at home.”*

c.     *“Friends, that happened”* – This referred to how he was unexpectedly and ruthlessly bullied for being feminine by his closest friends when he was younger.

Marco’s case does not fit well with the literature with regards to his resilience. It appears that he is functioning well, being a student in a highly competitive environment. However, his connections with people seem underwhelming, making his Relatedness deficient. Then, Marco’s case draws attention to the possibility that deep-rooted and unresolved psychological and emotional problems can spill over into corroding the built-up resilience; therefore, it would eat into the ability to cope with future crises as well. Nonetheless, there were two important coping mechanisms which Marco briefly touched on but did not explore enough to use for analysis: his religion and church community, and passion for music.

**iv.    Ray**

Ray does not appear to have any signs of emotional distress at the current moment, at least compared to when he was younger. This is because Ray was largely unaffected directly by the fallout of the separation. His feelings toward his father are clear-cut as he finds his dad to have no redeeming factors. The last caveat for Ray would be his perception of people in terms of how much value he can give them and vice versa. He finds that he needs to be constantly of value to people or they will no longer need him. Ray’s obsession with “value” started when he was very young and seemingly continues today, which directly affects his Relatedness.

Ray’s completion of the self-determination theory is peculiar as he stresses many times during the interview that people of his situation should take actions and that they must be active in changing their own situation. He appears to believe strongly in the power of personal responsibility, though he did acknowledge some faults with structure. However, on our self-efficacy scale, Ray agreed with 100% of statements which indicate a severe lack of self-efficacy. This discrepancy between the interview and the scale is confounding as Ray is the only person in this sample who have not only achieved a scholarship-funded education but also self-sufficiency through a well-paying and prestigious job.

1.     **Autonomy**: Ray's autonomy is definitely present as he feels most things in his life are in his direct control and he does not feel restraint by anyone else. This feeling is emphasized by the non-presence of his father, leaving him with a lot of space to make his own choices and take actions.

2.     **Competence**: This is definitely the most noticeable part of Ray's story as he interprets his success to be a direct result of his actions and those results are often positive. He studied hard to switch from Normal Academic to Express. He studied hard and begged to get into a good JC. From there he studied hard to earn multiple scholarships. He took on extra lessons and was able to kickstart his career. Ray attributes his success to his mindset and actions without a clear emphasis on the external factors that enabled these successes. The most significant example of Competence is the fact that his effort has lifted him out of poverty and concretized to him the fact that he has value.

a.     *“So, in a sense, it’s very very sad because I believe everyone, we can have the potential to really perform one. But we don’t really have the opportunity, cause we don’t fight for it y'know, when it presents itself, we don’t seize it. We don’t create it.  And that’s the problem.”*

b.     *“I told her this one thing ‘At the end of the day when I come to Pioneer Junior College ah, I’m not asking you to lower your benchmark, or lower your standard, I’m only asking for an opportunity to perform. Because I know I will soar.’ That’s what I told her.”*

3.     **Relatedness**: Ray's ability to relate with others is more difficult to ascertain. It is unclear whether other people provide emotional support to Ray or if Ray finds emotional support in anyone. This is because of the way he laid out his relationships with other revolves mainly about the idea of "value" or being valuable to others. This is grim if one considers how Ray finds that if you are not of value to someone, they would discard you. Most likely this stems from how Ray was stigmatized by the parents of his friends due to his family situation, a major blow on his self-conception.

a.     *“When I play with my friends, their parents or grandparents would ask them: ey, don’t- don’t play with that boy there, no use for what.”*

b.     *“If you’re of no value to other people right, why would they want to interact with you?”*

c.     *“You won’t even want to be with someone who have no y’know, immediate value to you. I would use the word “immediate value” la. (oh okay) Cause being with us, y'know, it's a potential game”*

Ray's adjustment ability is definitely present as he has been continuously coping with abject poverty. Not only that, he has not been practically hindered by multiple instances which would be traumatic for a typical person. I would like to bring up two examples to justify this assertion: Firstly, when he failed his PSLE and his brother engaged in criminal activities, he did not cave in to follow the same path or became passive towards his education. Secondly, after trying so hard to study, his grades were not enough to get into a Junior College whose entrance requirements were not high. Yet, this did not faze him and he continued to try to change the cards he has been dealt. In a Singaporean context, the failing of the PSLE and O-level are both major events.

**v.     Summary**

What has been shown here is the fact that Emotional Distress and Resilience, in fact, do not exist in a paradoxical nature as they are inherently not antithetical to each other. Emotional Distress has its roots deep within ACOSP’s psyche, stemming from their past and often directly centred upon a traumatic event, separation related or not. However, the separation event does often appear as a cause of this trauma mostly because it is highly disruptive, deeply impactful, and exceptionally unique. These factors make the trauma much more difficult to brush back or even forget, especially if has surreptitiously shaped how the ACOSP views the world. This would mean that challenging that distress or trauma would require a reframing of their many important world views which have influenced their decisions greatly thus far. Resilience, on the other hand, is a trait which can be acquired and honed. After the acquisition, it can be continuously reinforced and maintained. Yet, Resilience most likely will be useful to combat and cope with future crises, not past ones. Due to the fact that these two phenomena are not in symmetrical opposition, the causal chain remains the same.

### **c.   Recommendations**

Similar to Romantic Relationships, the approach to addressing the Emotional Distress for ACOSP also aims to tackle the deep-rooted trauma born of separation or separation-related events. Thus, Counselling would be the most ideal recommendation again. At this juncture, it is important to note that Counselling cannot be a one-off fix for such emotional distress as there is a high chance they can be triggered again. Thus, Counselling must be built on the foundation of a healthy and constructive relationship between Counsellor and client embedded with mutual trust and responsibility. This is why it is vital that the counsellors can maintain the counselling relationship; this can only be done if the counsellors are given resources to devote their effort to a small group of children rather than be overstretched and not giving enough time to each client. Not only that, if counselling is to be continued into the future, the counsellor cannot afford to rebuild the relationship from scratch, especially when their clients are traumatized, or hurt, children when they started. On the part of the government, more resources should be devoted to training counsellors capable of these tasks.

## **6.   Conclusion**

The small sample of ACOSP presented here has provided an enlightening peek into what can drive COSP towards pursuing education, how the separation of their parents can affect them directly and indirectly, and how they could possess resilience and emotional distress at the same time. Importantly, these findings allow a modification to the literature to reflect further the many nuances present in reality while accounting for an important group of outliers rarely represented in the literature. Aside from this, recommendations were also made in order to adequately address the root causes of emotional distress and dysfunctional behaviours in relationships centred around Counselling and providing social support while giving COSP incentives to internalize education as a solution to their problems.

However, the analysis conducted here is nowhere near exhaustive of the experience of ACOSP even in the three areas tackled. This is due to the small diversity of experience represented and the fact that they can be considered outliers. Thus, further research should be done using the findings to develop and fuller picture of these three aspects in ACOSP lives. Additionally, exploratory research should also be launched to consider the effectiveness of VWOs’ current intervention programmes, the most optimal counselling which can be delivered to COSP, and the other alternative social networks, i.e. religion, available to COSP.

Adult children of single parents are an overlooked and understudied group within the literature on single parenthood. They are considered as part of the outcome of single parenthood, yet, their turmoil, their struggles, and the challenges they face are rarely documented in great details. The discourse surrounding them focuses on their results in order to analyse single parenthood, glossing over the human beings behind the numbers with ambitions, pains, and dreams of their own.
