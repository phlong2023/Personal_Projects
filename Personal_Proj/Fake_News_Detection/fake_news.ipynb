        "This project was done as part of ISSS609: Text Analytics and Applications. The analysis was performed jointly with Chock Wan Kee, Denise Tan Shi Min, Lim Li Ying, Noel Ng Ser Ying, and Tan Yanni Regine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main language/tool: Python\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The proliferation of fake news is a growing global concern, impacting public opinion, political processes, and trust in media institutions. Fake news is defined as fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent (Lazer, et al., 2018). The spread of misinformation poses significant challenges to foster an informed citizenry as it makes people more susceptible to political misinterpretations (Guess, et al., 2020), thereby increasing the challenge of upholding credibility and integrity of information sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many experiments have been designed and conducted to put Machine Learning techniques to the test in detecting fake from true news. Our project seeks to determine if detection accuracy can be improved with additional features from sentiment analysis.  Sentiment analysis discerns the emotional tone of text, thereby providing insights to how information is framed and its potential impact on readers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this project is the “[Fake News Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/therealsampat/fake-news-detection/input?select=True.csv)” dataset from Kaggle. It contains fake and real news from 31 May 2015 to 19 Feb 2018. The two classes of data are separated into the respective “Fake” and “True” files, which will be combined for our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "We adopted a sequential approach to the analysis that is summarized in the flow chart below:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](images/clipboard-418630220.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, the separate “Fake” and “True” files had to be merged into one for analysis. To differentiate between the fake and real news after merging for classification, labels were assigned to each record from the same file, 0 for real news and 1 for fake news. After merging both files, the title and text columns are concatenated to create a corpus for text preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, preprocessing steps involving tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming are applied on the corpus. It was discovered that some words, such as days of the week and “say” or “said”, appeared in high frequency and did not help to distinguish one document from another. It is reasonable that these words appear frequently in news reports as they provide details on incidents which often include reported speech. In view of the above, we included these words as stop words to be removed from the corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "After identifying the best model, additional features such as sentiment analysis scores (including compound score from NLTK’s VADER and subjectivity and polarity scores from TextBlob) were incorporated into the model to evaluate their impact on enhancing the model’s performance. This is due to the fact that sentiment analysis has been shown to be a potentially powerful tool in identifying fake news, as will be elaborated later in the article.\n",
        "\n",
        "One challenge is the size of the corpus containing more than 40,000 documents. Choosing a model that can work efficiently with this corpus size will be a crucial factor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, three classification methods are used to find the best performing model in classifying fake news.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following sections will go into the codes used and describe their functions.\n",

        "It can be observed from a visual check of both datasets that certain words and phrases only appear in either data set, while some words appear in both data sets. These words, as shown in the table below, are removed from the corpus as they do not contribute much to distinguish the documents. For example, hyperlink markers such as \"www\" appears in many articles and provides no value.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Tokenize words and change to lowercase]{.underline}\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, to standardize the words in the corpus, .lower() is used to change all word cases to lower case. Following which, the text is tokenized using NLTK’s word_tokenize() function. This will treat each word as a separate component.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Remove stop words]{.underline}\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, stop words are removed from the text. Stop words are words found in text there are deemed unlikely to be useful in information retrieval. Stop words can be understood as words necessary in the use of language but does not provide value for the analysis. Some common stop words are \"the\", \"is\", \"are\". The STOPWORDS library from Gensim is used for this project as it contains the highest number of stop words (337 stop words).\n",
        "\n",
        "[Stemming]{.underline}\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, stemming is applied on the remaining words to normalize text by obtaining only the stem of words. Stemming reduces the variations of a word down to single root. For example, \"cats\" would simply become \"cat\". This is done using the .stem() function from the PorterStemmer module under NLTK.\n",

Days of the week and “says” or “said” are words commonly occurring in news articles. Hence, the pre-processing step is refined to include a custom list of stop words (each day of the week, “says”, “said”), and to only retain words that are longer than one character.\n",

        "\n",
        "First, the processed data is split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. This ratio is decided as it provides sufficient data to train the classification models (31,429 records), and adequate data to evaluate the performance of the models (13,469 records). Furthermore, this split also balances the computational resources required to train the models and leaves enough data for K-Fold Cross Validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the processed data is vectorized using the TfidfVectorizer, which converts raw strings into a matrix of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features.

The split X_train data is vectorized using the .fit_transform() function while the X_test data is vectorized using the .transform() function.\n",

The function also generates the confusion matrix created using the confusion_matrix() function from sklearn and the AUC-ROC curve, which plots true positive rate against false positive rate. This function can be called with each model to evaluate them separately.\n",

        "To achieve this, we wrote another function to evaluate each model using the k-fold evaluation method, where k = 10 in this project. This is implemented using the StratifiedKFold function from sklearn. This function splits the entire vectorized data set into 10 equal-sized parts with approximately similar proportions of class 0 and class 1 data. Next, we evaluated each model 10 times, each time using one fold as the validation set, and the average of the performance over 10 rounds of training and validation is used as the overall performance metric. This is achieved using the cross_validate() function from sklearn, and the precision, recall, f1-score, and support scores are created using the make_scorer() function from sklearn.\n",

        "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, aims to identify the emotional pattern within written text. By conducting sentiment analysis, the sentiment, attitudes, and emotions expressed by a piece of text can be determined (Liu, 2020). Such analysis is particularly relevant to the fake news detection as targeting emotions and provoking an emotional response are the main vectors of effectiveness and spread for fraudulent information (Bakir & McStay, 2018; Horner, et al., 2021). In addition, due to the prominent role that sentiments play in fake news, multiple studies have found that by including sentiment analysis, the performance of a fake news classifier can be improved (Ajao et al., 2019; Alonso et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, the goal of sentiment analysis is two-fold. First, sentiment analysis is an objective in and of itself, allowing the study to capture any emotional disparity between fake and genuine news and describe the usage of emotions in fake news. Second, the results of sentiment analysis can serve as new features for document classification, potentially improving its performance. We utilized two of the most popular Python packages, NLTK and TextBlob. However, it is important to note that a clear drawback of any sentiment analysis task based on existing dictionaries will be that the context of the dictionary might not match with the context of the current corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purpose of this project, sentiment analysis will be performed using two libraries, NLTK's VADER and TextBlob.\n",
        "\n",
        "### VADER\n",
        "\n",
        "NLTK is a powerful tool for natural language processing, including classifiers and sentiment lexicons for sentiment analysis. It works with many text analytics tasks, provides users with a pretrained lexicon and rule-based sentiment analyzer called Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) (Mogyorosi, n.d.). The VADER analyzer uses the vader_lexicon developed by C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert, which measures a sentiment intensity score from words, phrases and emojis, and based on their emotional content, from negative to positive. This vader_lexicon can be applied to a piece of written text using NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer’s polarity_score() function. SentimentIntensityAnalyzer can be applied to whole sentences instead of tokenized text. However, we note that VADER was trained specifically for social media data to handle complex language sentiments, which may not be completely applicable to fake news.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the VADER lexicon can be applied directly to text using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer(), polarity scores for each document in the corpus can be generated by applying .polarity_score() on each record of the processed text dataframe, df. Four score types can be generated from .polarity_score(), and we store each score in one newly created column in df:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Compound: overall sentiment score between -1 to 1\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Negative: negative sentiment score between 0 to 1\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Neutral: neutral sentiment score between 0 to 1\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Positive: positive sentiment score between 0 to 1\n",
        "\n",
        "The compound score is used as a feature in the classification model as it represents the overall sentiment of each document. The compound score is the sum of the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, normalized to be between -1 and +1 (Swarnkar, 2020).\n",

        "All three models that incorporated sentiment analysis scores (NLTK VADER, TextBlob, and Combined) showed an improvement in model performance compared to the baseline XGBoost model. These findings correlate with the studies cited that sentiment analysis may be a useful feature for enhancing model performance.\n",

        "### **Inclusion of Sentiment Analysis in Document Classification**\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of document classification using the results of sentiment analysis as additional features exhibit improvements over base classification models using only text as features. This shows that the consideration of sentiment analysis could be a fruitful endeavor in the identification of fake news. Additionally, it reinforces the idea that fake news tends to have more emotion expressors than regular news to incite an emotional response from readers. What is lacking, however, is a word-sentiment dictionary which might be more appropriate to the context of news articles. Such a dictionary might further improve the results of the classifications by allowing for better calculation of sentiment scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Named Entities**\n",
        "\n",
        "In news articles, it is very common for named entities to be used that might not be recognized in dictionaries, and with the lack of recognition, also comes the lack of context surrounding the entities. If the model can recognize these entities, this would then further enhance how it differentiates real news from fake news as there is additional information for the model to consider.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Data Source**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Kaggle dataset that was used seems to likely be from the United States. Most of the fake news were related to America’s politics and thus the model has been tuned to pick up keywords along this theme. This means that if we were to apply this model to datasets from around the world, the model might not be as applicable or accurate anymore as the topics identified will likely not be as relevant. For example, news about Trump’s inauguration might not be as big in Singapore, and thus if the model was used as-is to run on Singapore’s news, the results produced would thereby not be as accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Technical Limitations**\n",
        "\n",
        "As we were dealing with a large dataset and performing complex NLP tasks, we faced constraints such as computational resources and processing speed issues. Running the code sometimes took more than an hour, due to the nature of the computations that we were running. This was quite inefficient, as we needed to test multiple models and had several revisions of code, resulting in us having to spend time allowing the code to load.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Dynamic Nature of Fake News**\n",
        "\n",
        "As technology evolves, so do the methods of dissemination of fake news. With ever-changing tactics to deceive the masses, static models that are not continually updated will not be able to adapt to any emerging trends. As such, if the model is not regularly refreshed, it will sooner or later become obsolete and inaccurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future Work and Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) can extract important entities mentioned in news articles, such as the names of politicians, organizations, or locations. By analyzing the entities mentioned in both fake and real news, patterns may emerge that could indicate the credibility or authenticity of the article. Additionally, by analyzing the context surrounding named entities, NER can help detect instances of misinformation or propaganda. For example, if a fake news article mentions a well-known organization or individual in a misleading context, NER can help identify the discrepancy between the entity's actual role or stance and how it is portrayed in the article.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Extension of Data Source Scope** \n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle the second issue, a future extension of this project would then be to re-train the model based on local news. This would then help to include more local topics on top of the American news (as Singapore is so interlinked to the rest of the world, American news would not be completely irrelevant, so keeping this would not be completely useless). The accuracy and precision of the model would then be improved, and thereby we will be able to use this model for local news as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Regular Updating of Dataset**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our model will need to be updated regularly with more recent articles to ensure that it can continue to stay relevant and continue to identify fake news accurately, even those disseminated with new methods of trickery.\n",
